Dicegang - here's a sneak peek of the team video we've created for you guys.  We plan to promote this on social over the next few weeks and during our final event broadcast.  Please review and let us know if this is cleared for release.    Thanks!

looks awesome! Although I think the PFS logo was used in the background from 00:18 to 00:25 though instead of the dicegang logo

OB1  14:55
Excellent catch!  That is exactly why we do these reviews.  How does this version look?

looks great! Thumbs up from us

My teammates account with email defund.alt@gmail.com was deactivated, could you reactivate that account and add him to this channel?

vito  12:41
Let me see…

vito  12:46
Caught me afk and I can't figure out how to do it from my phone, I'll try in a half hour or so

hgarrereyn  12:47
no worries, anytime before finals start is fine :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

vito  13:07
ok so looking now
13:08
there's a deactivated defund.alt and a defund.alt+ctf at gmail; those both go to the same inbox, alright if i invite the +ctf version?

vito  14:13
@hgarrereyn ^^

hgarrereyn  14:14
lemme double check…
14:16
yep that should work

vito  14:38
@defund invited!

hey, we’ve been playing around with the digitaltwin and we have a few questions regarding the format of the competition:
what are the differences between the digital twin and the final competition format? i.e. we assume the main difference is that satellite systems will be running on physical hardware instead of hog, are there other differences with cosmos/42?
What is the format of the “vulnerable systems”? Will these be additional, vulnerable satellite subsystems we have to protect?
Are there rules about patching and/or physical constraints on patching?
Do you have information on cross-team networking? Do we have free reign to target other teams services? Will our traffic be anonymized?

vito  15:07

Hi Dicegang :wave:
I'm doing game commentary again this year (though we have fewer updates compared to last year). I'm hoping to have some extra tidbits to talk about each team as it's appropriate throughout the broadcasts. If you have any interesting facts you think would be fun to share, please add them in a thread here, thanks! Ideas include: how your team was formed, favorite stories during quals or previous HaS experiences, how many people in your team are professionals in the security field or professionals in the aerospace field or hobbyists or students. Anything is helpful!
Good luck tomorrow.

bump on the questions above. Or are you waiting to release this info until game start?

vito  10:48
we've seen the questions; there'll be more information released closer to game start

hgarrereyn  13:01
?
13:01
is anything supposed to be happening

hgarrereyn  13:42
are we in an isolated network? or do some of the other boxes we see correspond to other teams?

defund  14:59
We still haven't found the cosmos VM...
15:00
is the landing machine "Team X Game Infrastructure" on the diagram?

Deadwood  15:25
How are you trying to find the VM?

defund  15:26
portscanning I guess
15:26
but we scanned the entire 10.50.50.X range and only one host was up, our own

Deadwood  15:27
try looking for breadcrumbs on your landing machine.

defund  15:28
is the process running on port 111 relevant?

Deadwood  15:29
no

defund  15:31
oh, found it

vito  15:54
If you can read this message but aren't in 
finals-2021 please let me know

Deadwood  17:07
How are you feeling about the user segment challenge?  What is your current approach?

hgarrereyn  17:08
uh we’ve just been poking around in cosmos trying to download files
17:08
we’re not really sure what we’re supposed to be trying to do
17:09
we ran the solve scripts and accidentally nerfed our satellite and then figured out and fixed the operating mode

hgarrereyn  17:18
@Deadwood do you have our email for quals, we’re trying to log in to regatta
17:20
nevermind

Deadwood  19:53
How are you doing with use segment challenge?

hgarrereyn  20:25
we have reversed the rsa signature and packet encoding and we found the sus askForPubKey function
20:26
we’re playing around with wireshark and gdb rn

hgarrereyn  20:37
for challenge 3 do we get more points if we send a packet to more than one team per round?

defund  21:21
we seem to be getting locked out
21:21
of our boxes
21:21
as in they ask for password when we ssh\

taintedcheese  21:24
password is "team1"
21:24
let me know if that works

defund  21:24
ok yes we're in
21:24
thanks!

taintedcheese  21:24
np

defund  22:00
Should be worried about the battery of our flatsat?
22:01
it seems to be declining overall
22:01
each orbit

hgarrereyn  22:06
we’ve solved challenge 3 but we’re hitting “RATE LIMIT” for some teams even after a 6 minute round window
22:06
are we getting points for those still?

hgarrereyn  22:16
@taintedcheese re this? We’ve only been able to hit team 6 once and we’ve received RATE_LIMIT since then (in the past 20 minutes)
:eyes:
1


hgarrereyn  22:23
@taintedcheese we’re sending 6 messages every 2 minutes and still getting ratelimited
22:23
??

hgarrereyn  22:29
oh I am dumb

SirGoon  23:43
How are you feeling about the comms payload challenge? What is your approach?

defund  23:45
we're not 100% sure about how to communicate w/ the comms payload / if it's meant to be completely blackbox

taintedcheese  00:10
did you do something to your battery state?

defund  00:10
we switched to adcs_momentum_dump mode (edited) 
00:10
our current dropped to -infinity
00:11
after switching, our battery was at 0

taintedcheese  00:11
rgr

defund  00:11
our space engineer says this is impossible
00:11
simulation glitch

taintedcheese  00:11
we saw
00:12
if you charge your battery state above 40%, we will stop tracking
00:13
you will not be penalized if you charge it back to a reasonable level

defund  00:13
how exactly do we charge it back?

hgarrereyn  00:13
can we get a temporary +infinity current as remedy for the glitch

taintedcheese  00:15
your batteries are slowly charging right now, we will not order a space tug if you get it back to a reasonable level

defund  00:17
inevitably our batteries will decrease, right?
00:17
once we move back to the dark side

taintedcheese  00:18
we can do a quick restart of the flatsat instead if you request it
:+1:
1

00:18
hold for a sec

taintedcheese  00:24
If we charge your batteries instantly, can you drain your batteries back to 40%? (edited) 
00:25
to make it back to where it was before?

defund  00:25
what would be the easiest way to drain it?

hgarrereyn  00:25
~~momentum dump~~

taintedcheese  00:25
it will be down for 1-5 min, figure out how to draw more power to drain the batteries
00:27
time has reset, restart your telemetry graphs
00:27
you dont have to resolve challenge 1 and 2
00:27
satellite should be back
00:28
if you dont see nominal ops, ping me

hgarrereyn  00:29
things seem to be running well now

taintedcheese  00:29
thanks!

defund  00:46
we've rotated ourselves
00:46
so the solar panels aren't getting energy
:eyes:

defund  06:55
for challenge 2 were using the same commands as before and it keeps saying "invalid number of attributes 3 should be 6"
06:55
even though we provide all 6 just as before

taintedcheese  06:57
wrong chat, see the main chat

defund  07:00
the error we're having is on the load_tbl command
07:00
we cant load our table nor the one you gave us

taintedcheese  07:01
do you request a space tug reset button on the adcs, or the entire satellite?

defund  11:53
we may have killed one of our boxes for challenge6

spaceymcspaceface  11:55
should be back up
:+1:
1


defund  12:17
We're not supposed to upload patches for this challenge, right? Since each team has their own box

spaceymcspaceface  12:30
look at finals chat

SirGoon  12:31
How is your team doing on 5? Close?

hgarrereyn  12:32
not sure how to exploit but we’re trying a patch
