PolandCanIntoSpace- here's a sneak peek of the team video we've created for you guys.  We plan to promote this on social over the next few weeks and during our final event broadcast.  Please review and let us know if this is cleared for release.    Thanks!

redford  19:07
nice! I forwarded it to the team and I'll let you know if others are ok with it

redford  06:10
ok, you have green light from our team :)

redford  12:46
Hi, in one of the recent emails you wrote: "Note that a version of the HAS2 flatsat digital twin will be released to finalist teams one week prior to the competition." - just want to double check we didn't miss this
12:46
this wasn't released yet, right?

OB1  10:18
@redford you didn't miss anything.  We are doing some last minute checks and anticipate releasing the digital twin later today.

redford  10:23
ack, just wanted to be sure :)

Hi Poland Can :wave:
I'm doing game commentary again this year (though we have fewer updates compared to last year). I'm hoping to have some extra tidbits to talk about each team as it's appropriate throughout the broadcasts. If you have any interesting facts you think would be fun to share, please add them in a thread here, thanks! Ideas include: how your team was formed, favorite stories during quals or previous HaS experiences, how many people in your team are professionals in the security field or professionals in the aerospace field or hobbyists or students. Anything is helpful!
Good luck tomorrow.

Hi Poland Can :wave:…
hmm, a bit late for this, we're already in the preparations :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: but I'll try to write something down if I find time, if not then please bug me until I do

redford  12:45
thx

redford  12:57
do I understand correctly, that even application logic DoS is forbidden?
12:57
(i.e. DoS without any high network spamming)

redford  13:04
the old rules suggested that this is ok, but the ones in the .zip you just shared imply that this is not ok

redford  13:30
@vito @taintedcheese @Deadwood ping :wink:

Deadwood  13:31
what up?

redford  13:31
I mean the question I asked above

Deadwood  13:32
The latest rules take precedence.  See the last rule in that doc.

redford  13:32
but can you confirm that our understanding of them is correct?
13:32
we saw the document, just want to be sure we understood it correctly

Deadwood  13:33
We don't want intentional DOS attacks of any sort.

redford  13:34
ack

redford  14:23
we don't have the tarball on the cosmos VM
14:24
are we doing something wrong?
14:24
@vito @taintedcheese @Deadwood ^

vito  14:25
investigating

redford  14:43
we've tried to download a non-existing file from COSMOS and the whole satellite seems to be bricked :confused: (edited) 

taintedcheese  14:45
We tasked the space tug to ZPO with your satellite

redford  14:46
ok, works now
14:46
thanks

finals-2021 please let me know

Deadwood  17:07
How are you feeling about the user segment challenge? What is your current approach?

redford  17:15
we are almost there
17:15
already iterating throught the priv keys
17:16
but it's pretty computation-heavy, we have ~5000000 seed candidates
17:17
@Deadwood ^

redford  17:30
I guess we need to rewrite it to C++, not just hook with LD_PRELOAD as we do now, or rent a huge server for bruteforcing :slightly_smiling_face:
17:32
ok, it's actually only ~300k seeds
17:32
looks better

redford  19:18
our api doesn't work, but we can successfully connect to other teams apis

redford  19:26
isn't that a bug in the setup for our sat?
19:30
@Deadwood ^

Deadwood  19:35
Everything is working as intended.

redford  19:54
@Deadwood FYI: seems we accidentally solved the crypto chall with attribution_id set to team 1, so I guess they got points but without solving it
19:54
(I'm writing this because we're a bit afraid that you'll release solvers for challenges after n teams solved them, like last year)

Deadwood  19:56
See the main channel

redford  20:22
how are the points on the scoreboard calculated?
20:22
and how do we know if we scored the challenge correctly, with correct attribution key?
20:26
this round we scored lower number of points than other teams, despite solving chall 3

redford  20:33
@Deadwood also: we noticed problems with negative power budget for all teams, so to not completely discharge we're turning off unused ADCS sensors and actuators in eclipse (wheels, CSS, FSS). After turning them off on scorboard our ground station turns red
20:33
why is this happening?
20:37
during this all telemetry and commands work just fine in COSMOS, but we're not seeing SLA_TLM ping packets

SirGoon  23:43
How are you feeling about the comms payload challenge? What is your approach?

Rev  23:57
we're still tweaking our exploit code for the arm binary. we've got the vulnerability and we're feeling we're going to score

taintedcheese  23:57
let me know when you are about to throw, please

Rev  00:18
I think we've submitted a valid flag
00:19
just need to automate the exploit now

taintedcheese  00:19
what team did you exploit

Rev  00:19
id 2

taintedcheese  00:22
ty for the info

taintedcheese  00:49
Can you give me a quick update on your approach?

redford  00:57
we have a heap BOF, it works but rate limit is too low
00:57
so we can hack only 2 teams per round
00:58
alternatively, you could increase the max packet size on the proxy (right now it's around 256 bytes)
00:58
the challenge works on bigger packets
00:58
we could exploit it in a single packet
00:59
but the proxy limits the size
00:59
@taintedcheese ^
01:02
also, you have a stability bug there, you don't check the return value of read()
01:02
i.e. it doesn't loop on short reads
01:03
so, if we're unlucky because of the network delays the read will trim the packets

redford  01:10
@SirGoon @Deadwood @vito ping :wink: we can't exploit more than 2 teams per round because of this ^

redford  01:39
also, how does the scoring work? we get a very low number of points for chall 4 each round, and it seems independent of the number of teams we exploited
01:39
e.g. sometimes we exploit 2 teams and sometimes 4-5
01:40
but point we get vs top1 (which don't have an exploit for this chall AFAIK) are 32, 32, 28 in the last 3 rounds
01:40
this seems to have no correlation with the number of submitted flags :confused:

meenmachine  01:42
Your assumptions are incorrect.

redford  01:44
about packet limits?

redford  01:53
@meenmachine ^

taintedcheese  01:58
see the finals-2021 slack channel

redford  01:59
@taintedcheese which of our questions are you answering right now?
01:59
sorry, we are really confused

taintedcheese  02:02
"also, how does the scoring work? we get a very low number of points for chall 4 each round, and it seems independent of the number of teams we exploited" - see vitos recent post in the main channel
02:03
I have seen the other questions, and thanks for the information on your approach

redford  02:04
hmm, I don't understand how vitos answer could explain this (you mean this one? ""internal scoreboard" is https://regatta.mc.satellitesabove.us/scoreboard as opposed to https://finals.2021.hackasat.com/ or http://10.3.133.7:5000/queries/1")
02:04
we looked at this scoreboard
02:04
the only additional information we see is the time until the round end (edited) 

taintedcheese  02:04
Oh, I'm sorry, i thought he put the post out
02:05
working on it!

redford  02:07
I have seen the other questions, and thanks for the information on your approach
so, will you be changing anything, or should we somehow try to grind our exploit to be faster? e.g. renting a server in US or something like this

redford  03:29
could you say why are we gaining less points than other teams? we have the solver for chall 4 and the satellite is green
03:30
does the green satellite imply 100% possible points of SLA?
03:30
I mean, it seems that everything works, but somehow we're getting less points than others
03:30
and we have no idea if that's because of SLA or challenges

redford  06:32
could you share that /cosmos/procedures/hack-a-sat/eps_mgr_cfg_tbl_working.json file with us? previously you applied this change manually and now we don't have it and can't restore ADCS
06:33
@taintedcheese ^

taintedcheese  06:34
we didnt share that file with any other teams, did you have a version of that table pulled from the filesystem?

redford  06:35
no, we couldn't get it because the satellite said that it can't dump this table
06:35
so we never got it

meenmachine  06:35
Send the same command

redford  06:37
same as what? to dump this file?
06:37
we don't have that script because it failed to dump

meenmachine  06:38
Yes. Please try dumping the file one more time. We're watching your sat

redford  06:39
we can dump the script now, but it's not the working one
06:40
and after you deployed that working one before the reset we weren't able to dump

meenmachine  06:40
Just to confirm. You're able to download the table file?

redford  06:41
yes, but that's not the working one which you applied previously

meenmachine  06:42
All the teams received the exact same challenge solvers for challenges 1 and 2 (edited) 

redford  06:44
After you uploaded the valid tables for us we were not able to dump this valid table via cosmos due to some errors.
This means we can't use the "solver" due to lack of those table files

redford  06:51
@meenmachine so, will you share these tables? we got literally a 2-minute notice, after more than 17h of playing the CTF that our sat will suddenly get restarted
06:52
we're losing tons of points per round because of this
:eyes:

06:52
Solar Wine got ~700 pts more ahead only because of this
06:53
and Solar Wine has the solver, because contrary to other teams they've found these scripts you left somewhere in the beginning of the competition :/
06:57
also, Solar Wine would get run out of their battery, but you just arbitrarily refilled them for everyone :/

redford  07:52
@meenmachine @taintedcheese could you check what happened to our satellite?
07:52
everything suddenly went down without any interaction from us

taintedcheese  07:52
checking

redford  07:53
no telemetry data, neither from sat nor from 42 emu

taintedcheese  07:54
Is it better now?

redford  07:54
yes
07:54
what was it?

SirGoon  12:31
How is your team doing on 5? Close?

redford  12:33
nothing works for us tbh. we enabled events from comm module and we see some packets on event stream when transmitting some bytes on the network, but we are not able to send proper commands
12:33
no idea why the commands doesn't work ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ (edited) 
12:37
we guess that the proxy (for which we don't have binaries nor sources) somehow mangles the messages
12:37
e.g. adding/stripping some headers
