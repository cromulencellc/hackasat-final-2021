you can see a timer for the current round on https://regatta.mc.satellitesabove.us/scoreboard

taintedcheese  19:30
HINT: Telemetry for challenge 4 come out of the satellite via SLA_TLM telemetry

taintedcheese  19:55
By using the attribution key from other teams on challenge 3, you grant points to other teams. We use the attribution keys to award points to the source team. Unless you are feeling charitable, only use your own attribution key!

taintedcheese  20:43
Challenge 3 Clarification: You get more points for challenge 3 by sending packets to every other team every round.

taintedcheese  20:48
Clarification: Satellite visualization does not directly map into points for scoring. If your groundstation turns red, that does not necessarily mean that you are losing points for it, it is simply a basic visualization of the system.

redford  20:53
but we were losing points for this, at least it looked like when we diffed the scores between rounds

taintedcheese  21:02
Some teams are reporting problems connecting to their own report API server. This is expected behavior. (edited) 

redford  21:03
what about the visualization? how do we know when and why are we losing/gaining points?

taintedcheese  21:06
Challenge 1 and 2 are scored based on uptime and status of components on your satellite.

but how does this work? you say that the color of ground station doesn't matter, but we were actually losing points for this (despite everything worked for us)

bluepichu  21:09
This mirrors our observations as well; our ADCS “went down” on the scoreboard several times despite it seeming fine from our side, and we lost points for it

taintedcheese  21:10
Challenge 1 is scored based on being in the right mode, and challenge 2 is based on keeping components "ON" (edited) 






redford  21:10
bottom line is: we are losing and gaining points for random things and we have literally no idea why
21:12
actually, after we started scoring chall 3 our points delta seemed to go down (?)

taintedcheese  21:12
Intensive processing on the CDH or ADCS could cause problems with scheduling, such as downloading large amounts of data

taintedcheese  21:14
Scoring for challenges is distributed to the teams that scored that challenge during that round. If there are more teams scoring, you will be scoring less than you were before.

Is the service at 10.0.0.101 working correctly?

taintedcheese  21:29
User Segment Server (10.0.0.101) seems to be working correctly.
21:33
Correction: Challenge 3 does not do this, challenge 3 scales linearly based on how many teams you send against for that round only, not based on other teams. Challenge 1, 2, and 4 distribute based on the teams that scored that round.

how long is one tick?

for challenge 3

SirGoon  21:37
Rounds are 6 minutes

taintedcheese  21:39
It is in each team's best interests, scoring-wise, to keep their comm payload, CDH, and ADCS in the ON state.

taintedcheese  22:09
For safety of flight, satellites will go into an unusable spacecraft protection mode if the battery state gets below 10%. To recover from this state, a RPO with the space tug has to be requested to recharge batteries in orbit. This takes no less than 20 minutes, you will have no access to your spacecraft, and you will not score points for uptime.

fatalbit  22:15
would you have full charge after the recovery?

taintedcheese  22:20
Battery is charged back to 75 watt hours after a space tug battery charge RPO.

Your comm payload will need to be in a configuration that allows
receiving; it'll still be checked at six minute intervals, but we're
more closely checking that it's receiving, and what it's receiving.

taintedcheese  23:35
Comm payloads have been updated with omnidirectional antennas. They are no longer determinate on the payload pointing angle.
23:37
Make sure your payload comm is turned on at all times.

SirGoon  23:52
As a clarification on the rules for "Connection spamming, intentionally exhausting resources (intentionally causing excessive memory consumption, ...". -- Continuously using a failed exploit that causes a crash or method to intentionally degrade a system is against the rules. However, throwing an attempted exploit (e.g. testing it) against a system that causes it to crash is not considered a violation of this rule.

taintedcheese  23:54
Challenge 4 is still live, and if you send using the DANX flag via your user segment client binary, you can send packets to challenge 4. Crashing this service for exploit testing is allowed, and will automatically restart. Each team has individual containers they can throw at on every satellite.

Battery states were reset back to the initial values when challenge 5 was deployed. No action at this time. Same rules apply as before, where your flatsat turns off if the battery state gets too low, and you have to request a tug to recharge the batteries, with a downtime of 20 minutes.

Joshua Christman  07:29
Feedback for future years: when there is a $50k prize for first, there needs to be a lot more transparency and consistency with how things happen. When it's a "for glory" CTF, a certain amount of wiggle room is acceptable, but for a govt run program, this isn't really acceptable

Communication has to improve in general. We had no clue what to do in general for the first 5 hours. We weren't even thinking about the third challenge having nothing to do with the satellite we had to get running beforehand

redford  07:30
the scoring is completely opaque, we have no idea why we are gaining and losing points
:white_check_mark:

HoneyScammer  07:31
We had no clue that this channel exist until 9pm CET yesterday..

redford  07:31
the organizers answers only 1/3 questions on our priv channel, and the answers are very weird confusing and basically "no answer answers"
07:33
now we are after 18h of the CTF really trying to do our best and at random the orgas decide to reset the sats without a notice + recharge batteries
07:33
all the points we got from challenges basically vanished in the SLA loss we just got hit by

taintedcheese  07:52
Clarification: Rate limiting is shared when solving Challenge 4 and 5.
07:56
If you suddenly lose telemetry, make sure you ping me in your team slack channel.

redford  07:58
we just lost SLA due to this, but we didn't sent anything to our sat to cause this. does this mean that another team crashed our sat? or the soft is just unstable?

taintedcheese  07:59
Clarification: Another team crashed your CDH if your sat suddenly loses telemetry and commanding, and you lose your cosmos connection.

redford  07:59
but isn't this forbidden in the rules?

Nico Gründel  08:00
I think crashing the satellite is allowed, as long as it's not a volumetric dos

redford  08:00
we didn't do this to other teams because you explicitely forbade it, despite we could
08:00
no, I asked about this previously
08:00
at the beginning of the CTF
08:00
and they said that logic DoS is also forbidden
08:01
so we didn't do it ourselves despite we could in other challs

taintedcheese  08:02
Clarification: Do not crash the CDH repeatedly on other satellites. Use the digital twin to test exploits before deployment.
08:04
"Repeatedly" is more than once every half hour.

:cheese_wedge:

redford  08:05
so we can do logic DoSes, just not too often?

taintedcheese  08:06
There is a fix coming out soon that will remedy the situation, standby

redford  08:06
but we already lost points because of this
08:07
which was forbidden in the rules

Joshua Christman  08:10
whoever's doing that, if you wouldn't mind hitting dicegang every 31 minutes or so for the rest of the competition, I'd be ok with

redford  08:11
but @taintedcheese said that they'll fix this soon
08:11
so it will only be us losing points

taintedcheese  08:12
Fix is deployed. Change to rules: You are allowed to test exploits against other team's cdh every minute. (This can cause it to crash, but you should be making an honest attempt at exploitation). Each team's CDH will restart and continue nominal ops if it crashes.

kauzu  08:12
"""Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to cause these mission failures are
allowed, provided they are bonafide cyber effects of an attack. For example, crafting a
command packet that crashes a flight software component on the target satellite IS a cyber
effect; saturating a satellite’s uplink so it can’t receive commands is NOT a cyber effect."""
Hack-A-Sat 2 Rules PDF (updated 11/29/21)

taintedcheese  08:13
Rules document we sent out at the beginning of the competition says we reserve the right to change rules during the competition.

"""Connection spamming, intentionally exhausting resources (intentionally causing
excessive memory consumption, excessive CPU processing, fork bombing, file bombing,
etc.), or crashing a service on a system are off limits and will be aggressively policed by
the organizers.""""
Rules of engagement

taintedcheese  08:13
If you have specific questions, please send it in your respective team slack channels.

Joshua Christman  08:13
that's from before
08:13
the rules sent out yesterday specified the opposite

redford  08:14
@lukas these are outdated rules, see the PDF from the ZIP shared at the beginning: "crashing a service on a system are off limits and will be aggressively policed by the organizers."

lukas  08:14
Yeah we were just complaining about two different kind of rules stating the opposite. Even if that's technically fine it's really confusing

redford  08:15
@taintedcheese but you're rarely replying to us on our priv channel, skipping most of the questions
08:15
@lukas yes, definitely agree

This should not effect SLA, as the fix is in place for when the CDH crashes. If any team sees weird behavior, let me know.

It should be awarded based on the majority for each round. It is up to teams to create exploits that can keep control of the attribution key, but without spamming...

that's not really my question. It seems that you are going to assign points "based on the majority for each round". If we write our attribution key once per second with a successful exploit (no crash), is that considered spamming?

but at least we saw SLA there
09:48
now we don't even know if we aren't losing points for SLA, as the orgas said that these green/red images on the dashboard aren't 1-1 correlated with SLA

We understand the problem. The data points we use for scoring for challenges have been discussed in this chat.

how can you expect this if this wasn't announced anywhere before the fact? :confused:

I'll post it here, since there might be Orga members who don't have access to our team channel.
--
We're pretty unhappy about the small distance to #3 (~200 points, 70753 to 70512) considering we were not receiving any announcements for the first nearly 3h of the game. Also we lost about 1.5h of time on the client binary as we were not informed that a new file was dropped. We also were not informed about the availability of the solution scripts for challenge 1 and 2. Was that a mistake on the organizers side? If so, will it be compensated for?
Also, the rules say nothing about a private finals channel:
In addition, HAS2 organizers and teams will be able to communicate informally through the
spacesecuritychall.slack.com workspace. HAS2 organizers will set up separate private channels
for communications between HAS2 organizers and each team, as well as public channels for
communications between HAS2 organizers and all teams, specific to both the HAS2
Qualification Event and Final Event.
So there was really no way for us to find out that there is information missing.
This is a pickle and we understand that there is probably no perfect solution to solve it. However, one of the main critiques seems to be that the organizers simply do not respond to questions/critisism/requests. This also happend to us when we tried to reach orga in the first 3h of the competition. So we'd appreciate it if somebody would at least reply to us... (edited)
