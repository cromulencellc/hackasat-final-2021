SingleEventUpset - here's a sneak peek of the team video we've created for you guys.  We plan to promote this on social over the next few weeks and during our final event broadcast.  Please review and let us know if this is cleared for release.    Thanks!

Hi Singleeventupset :wave:
I'm doing game commentary again this year (though we have fewer updates compared to last year). I'm hoping to have some extra tidbits to talk about each team as it's appropriate throughout the broadcasts. If you have any interesting facts you think would be fun to share, please add them in a thread here, thanks! Ideas include: how your team was formed, favorite stories during quals or previous HaS experiences, how many people in your team are professionals in the security field or professionals in the aerospace field or hobbyists or students. Anything is helpful!
Specifically, if I'm not missing my guess, ya'll have team members who've been playing for a CTF for a long time right? Like way back when I was active playing in defcon (so you know it was a while ago)? Pretty sure I finally realized the connection when I saw the bio stated Cincinatti OH but want to make sure I'm not mixing teams. Not that I plan to call out specifics on stream but just making sure my mental association is right.
Good luck tomorrow.

Hi folks, where should we be able to reach https://regatta.mc.satellitesabove.us/ from?  It resolves to a private IP, but we haven't found access yet, even from the landing zone.  Perhaps that's by design?  Thanks!

How are you feeling about the user segment challenge? What is your current approach?

Hi folks, is it intentional that we're able to hit the API server curl 10.0.X1.100:1337  for all of the other teams (X=1,2,3,4,5,7,8), but not our own (X=6)?  Thanks!

Deadwood  21:04
The system is operating as intended

How are you feeling about the comms payload challenge? What is your approach?

Carolyn Drerup  23:49
We are working on RE on the provided binary. We believe we have to craft a packet to send to another satellite, using the solution to the user segment (which we have not figured out). If we properly send that command, then we could potentially leak data into the SLA_TLM data that comes back from the comms payload, and then we can pull it out through the APIs. (We've been pulling telemetry data from all other satellites using those APIs)
23:50
In general, we do not feel like we're close to a solution.

How is your team doing on 5? Close?

j0nam1el  12:35
We think we've blocked the other teams from scoring, but haven't figured out how to score ourselves.  I think it's unlikely that we'll solve in next 25 mins
