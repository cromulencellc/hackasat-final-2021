The MSIS86 atmosphere model is courtesy of the National Space Science Data Center and the Community Coordinated Modeling Center at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.  It is available (as Fortran code) via anonymous ftp from ftp://hanna.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/modelweb/  
From the readme:
"The Mass-Spectrometer-Incoherent-Scatter-1986 (MSIS-86) neutral atmosphere 
model describes the neutral temperature and the densities of He, O, N2, O2, 
Ar, H, and N. The MSIS model is based on the extensive data compilation and 
analysis work of A. E. Hedin and his collaborators [A. E. Hedin et al., J. 
Geophys. Res. 82, 2139-2156, 1977; A. E. Hedin, J. Geophys. Res. 88, 10170-
10188, 1983; A. E. Hedin, J. Geophys. Res. 92,  4649, 1987]. MSIS-86 
constitutes the upper part of the COSPAR International Reference Atmosphere 
(CIRA-86)."
