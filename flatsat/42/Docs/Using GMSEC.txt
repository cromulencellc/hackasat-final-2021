Using GMSEC

1)  In Makefile, uncomment GMSEC* environment variable settings
2)  make clean and make (of course)
3)  Start GMSEC message bus server: MBserver
4)  In Inp_IPC.txt, set Socket Role to GMSEC_CLIENT
5)  In Inp_IPC.txt, set Port to whatever MBserver uses (9000 on my installation)
6)  In terminal window(s), start Rx client first, then Tx client
