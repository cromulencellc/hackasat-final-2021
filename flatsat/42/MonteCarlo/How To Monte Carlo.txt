How to set up, run, and archive a Monte Carlo simulation campaign.

1)  Copy desired InOut folder into the MonteCarlo folder.  I have renamed it 
    "Baseline", but you are free to rename it to anything.
2)  Tailor RunMC.m to this campaign.
    a) Set the BasePath (e.g. './Baseline')
    b) Set the number of runs, Nrun
    c) Set the maximum number of CPU cores to use, MaxCore
    d) Allocate any output variables
    e) Modify "Modify Input Files" section to generate variables
       and insert them into input files as needed
    f) Under "Process Run in Matlab/Octave", perform any desired processing
       of each run's output data.  Note that some of this processing might
       be much faster if done within 42 (say, in 42report.c) than if done
       in Matlab/Octave.
    g) Edit "Save only selected *.42 files" as desired
    h) Under "Delete unaltered *.txt files", comment out deletion of any 
       input files that were altered.
    i) Edit "Post-processing" as desired to find and present the campaign-
       level results.
3)  In Matlab/Octave, set working directory to MonteCarlo.
4)  Call RunMC.m from Matlab/Octave command line.

On completion, the MonteCarlo folder contains the Baseline sim case inputs, 
any input and output files you spared from deletion (we recommend saving the altered input files as part of the record), and any campaign-level results you saved from your post-processing.  The MonteCarlo folder is thus a self-contained record of the campaign, suitable for archiving.

There is nothing special about the MonteCarlo folder itself.  Multiple campaigns may coexist, each in their own folder, e.g. "LVTipOffCampaign", "MC_SafeholdEntry", and "XprodSurvey".  If they are moved up or down in the directory structure, then some paths in RunMC.m must be modified appropriately.

RunMC.m calls BatchRun.sh and OverwriteLineInFile.m.  Both are in 42/Utilities.
