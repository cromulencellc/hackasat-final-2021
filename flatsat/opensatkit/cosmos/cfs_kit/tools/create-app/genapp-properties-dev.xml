The design and capabilities of appgen are intentionally very simple. AppGen
is designed to create a shell cFS application using simple string substitution.
It's not solving a complex problem so it should be very easy to use, configure,
extend, and maintain. 

AppGen is given a base directory where template source files are located and a
base target directory where the instantiated files are created. This property
provides default template and target directories. These directory paths are 
relative to AppGen's working directory. The user can override these defaults.

This file defines properties used by the cFS Application Generation tool. Key
string constants are defined in the tool.Costants.java source file.

The "template-var" entry defines case sensitive template variables that are
replaced by AppGen with the new App's name. They template variables should 
not need to change but are defined as a property just in case.

Each template base directory must contain a file called. genapp-template.xml.
This file tells appgen which subdirectories/files to instantiate. New 
application templates are easy to add by creating a directory hierarchy
containing template files and an appgen-template.xml.
