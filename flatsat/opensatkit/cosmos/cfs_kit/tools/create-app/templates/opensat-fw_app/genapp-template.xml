This file defines the directory and files containing templates to be 
instantiated by the OpenSat AppGen tool.  Refer to the OpenSat USer's
Guide or to appgen_properties.xml for more information.

Each "entry" defines the directory path (relative to where this file
resides) and the files to be instantiated.  The directory is specified
in the "key" attribute. "dir-" is a prefix to tell appgen that a directory
is being defined and all of the text following "dir-" will be converted
to a directory path. A '/' is used as a directory path symbol because it
is not allowed in a directory name on both Windows and Linux systems.
The appropriate '/' or '\' platform specific character will be substituted.
For example 

   entry key="dir-fsw/for_build" 

will result result in 'fsw\for_build' on a Windows platform.

Files within a directory that a user wants instantiated are listed between
the "entry" and "/entry" tags using commas to separate the file names.
