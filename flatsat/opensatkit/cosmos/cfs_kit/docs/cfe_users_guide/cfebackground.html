<h1><a class="anchor" name="cfebackground">Background</a></h1>The Core Flight Executive (cFE) is an application development and run-time environment. The cFE provides a set of core services including Software Bus (messaging), Time, Event (Alerts), Executive (startup and runtime), and Table services. The cFE defines an application programming interface (API) for each service which serves as the basis for application development. <br>
<p>
The cFE Software Bus service provides a publish and subscribe messaging system that allows applications to easily plug and play into the system. Applications subscribe to cFE services at runtime, making system modifications easy. Facilitating rapid prototyping, new applications can be compiled, linked, loaded, and started without requiring the entire system to be rebuilt.<p>

<p>
Each service comes complete with a built in application that allows users to interface with each service. To support reuse and project independence, the cFE contains a configurable set of requirements and code. The configurable parameters allow the cFE to be tailored for each environment including desk-top and closed loop simulation environments. This provides the ability to run and test software applications on a developer's desktop and then deploy that same software without changes to the embedded system. In addition the cFE includes the following software development tools:<p>
<ul>
<li>
Unit Test Framework (UTF) for unit testing applications developed via the cFE  </li>
<li>
Software Timing Analyzer that provides visibility into the real-time performance of embedded systems software  </li>
<li>
Table Builder  </li>
<li>
Command and Telemetry utilities  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The cFE is one of the components of the Core Flight System (CFS), a platform and project independent reusable software framework and set of reusable software applications. There are three key aspects to the CFS architecture: a dynamic run-time environment, layered software, and a component based design. The combination of these key aspects along with an implementation targeted to the embedded software domain makes it suitable for reuse on any number of NASA flight projects and/or embedded software systems. <br>
<p>
The pivotal design feature, abstracting the software architecture from the hardware and forming the basis of reuse, is component layering. Each layer of the architecture “hides” its implementation and technology details from the other layers by defining and using standard Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The internals of a layer can be changed without affecting other layers’ internals and components. <br>
<p>
<div align="center">

</div>
<p>
The layers include an OS Abstraction Layer (OSAL), Platform Support Package (PSP) layer, core Flight Executive (cFE) layer, and an Application layer. The cFE layer runs on top of the PSP and OSAL layers. The cFE comes complete with a build environment, deployment guide, API reference guide, and provides a sample PSP. The OSAL is available open source and once integrated into the cFE build environment, developers will be ready to build and run the system and start developing their mission/project specific applications that easily plug and play into the system.<p>
<h2>Core Flight Executive (cFE) Goals </h2>
<p>
The main long term goal of the cFE is to form the basis for a platform and project independent reusable software framework. The cFE with the OSAL allow the development of portable embedded system software that is independent of a particular Real Time Operating System and hardware platform. A secondary long term goal is to create a standardized, product-line approach for development of embedded aerospace flight software. <br>
<p>
<h3>Functional and Community Goals </h3>
<p>
The cFE allows embedded system software to be developed and tested on desktop workstations and ported to the target platform without changing a single line of code, providing a shorter development and debug time. The cFE is an enabler of software collaboration amongst all users promoting the growth of the application and library layers where new applications, libraries, tools, and lessons learned can be contributed and shared. <br>
<p>
It is important for application developers to realize the long term and functional goals of the cFE. With a standard set of services providing a standard API, all applications developed with the cFE have an opportunity to become useful on future missions through code reuse. In order to achieve this goal, applications must be written with care to ensure that their code does not have dependencies on specific hardware, software or compilers. The cFE and the underlying generic operating system API (OS API) have been designed to insulate the cFE Application developer from hardware and software dependencies. The developer, however, must make the effort to identify the proper methods through the cFE and OS API to satisfy their software requirements and not be tempted to take a "short-cut" and accomplish their goal with a direct hardware or operating system software interface. <hr size="1"><address style="align: right;"><small>Generated on Mon Jun 29 12:31:32 2015 for Core Flight Executive on  by&nbsp;
