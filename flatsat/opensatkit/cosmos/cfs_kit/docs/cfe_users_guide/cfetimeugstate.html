<h1><a class="anchor" name="cfetimeugstate">Time State</a></h1>Clock state is a combination of factors, most significantly whether the spacecraft time has been accurately set and whether Time Service is operating in FLYWHEEL mode. A ground command is provided to set the state to reflect when the ground has determined the spacecraft time is now correct, or that time is no longer correct. This information will be distributed to Time Clients, and in turn, to any interested sub-systems. If time has not been set then TIME services reports the state of time as invalid, regardless of whether time is flywheeling or not. Also, this command may be used to force a Time Server or Time Client into FLYWHEEL mode. Use of FLYWHEEL mode is mainly for debug purposes although, in extreme circumstances, it may be of value to force Time Service not to rely on normal time updates. Note that when commanded into FLYWHEEL mode, the Time Service will remain so until receipt of another "set state" command setting the state into a mode other than FLYWHEEL. Note also that setting the clock state to VALID or INVALID on a Time Client that is currently getting time updates from the Time Server will have very limited effect. As soon as the Time Client receives the next time update, the VALID/INVALID selection will be set to that of the Time Server. However, setting a Time Client to FLYWHEEL cannot be overridden by the Time Server since the Time Client will ignore time updates from the Time Server while in FLYWHEEL mode.<p>
