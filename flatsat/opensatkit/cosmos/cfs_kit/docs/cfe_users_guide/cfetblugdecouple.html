<h1><a class="anchor" name="cfetblugdecouple">How To Remove cFE Table Services</a></h1>It is possible to build the CFE without including Table Services.  This is only applicable if the mission does not intend to use any CFS applications that require CFE type table services, or if the mission intends to provide custom table services. If CFE Table Services are removed, the CFE makefile will no longer try to make the Table Services application and the link makefile will no longer include the Table Services object module in the CFE-CORE. Even if excluded from the build, the Table Services source and header files will remain in the CFE source tree.<p>
The variable EXCLUDE_CFE_TBL in the setvars.sh file controls whether, or not, CFE Table Services application is included in the CFE-CORE. The value of EXCLUDE_CFE_TBL must be set equal to TRUE to cause Table Services to be excluded from the CFE-CORE.  Any definition of EXCLUDE_CFE_TBL that does not set the value equal to TRUE (or no definition at all) will result in the inclusion of cFE Table Services. The default setvars.sh file contains the line "# EXCLUDE_CFE_TBL=TRUE", but note that the "#" symbol marks this line as a comment. Remove the "#" symbol to enable the definition that excludes CFE Table Services.<p>
Removing Table Services reduces the size of the CFE-CORE load file and also reduces the amount of RAM memory required to load the cFE. Each development environment will have unique savings. The numbers from a test performed using a MCP-750 platform with a GCC compiler are provided for reference:<p>
Size of cFE binary load file with Table Services: 830,969 Size of cFE binary load file w/o Table services: 721,466<p>
Amount of available RAM after loading cFE with Table Services: 76,513,488 Amount of available RAM after loading cFE w/o Table Services: 77,151,984<p>
