**  Function:  UTF_add_volume()
**
**  Purpose:
**    Configures the Volume Table for filesystem calls.  Each call to this function
**    will add another entry to the Volume Table.
**
**    There are two ways to configure the filesystem,
**        1. by making a single call to UTF_add_volume to set everything
**        2. by making a call to UTF_add_volume to set only the device name and physical device and then call OS_mkfs and OS_mount
**           The only time you would want to use option 2 is where the task you are testing calls OS_mkfs and OS_mount.  Most of
**           the time the system will do this for you on startup.
**
**    Option 1
**    - adds the device "/nonvol0"
**    - maps the filesystem to a directory "tmp" in the current working directory
**    - is filesystem based
**    - is not volatile
**    - is not free
**    - is mounted
**    - the volume name is "CF"
**    - the virtual filesystem is "/cf", i.e. references to the virtual directory "/cf" get translated
**      to the physical directory "tmp/nonvol0/".  Note that this directory should already exist.
**    - block size is 0
**
**      UTF_add_volume("/nonvol0", "tmp", FS_BASED, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, "CF", "/cf", 0);
**
**    Option 2
**    - adds the device "/nonvol0"
**    - maps the filesystem to a directory "tmp" in the current working directory
**    - is filesystem based
**    - is not volatile
**    - is free - needed for OS_mkfs
**    - is not mounted - needed for OS_mount
**    - the volume name is " " - set by OS_mkfs
**    - the virtual filesystem is " ", - set by OS_mount
**    - block size is 0
**
**      UTF_add_volume("/nonvol0", "tmp", FS_BASED, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, " ", " ", 0);
**      status = OS_mkfs(0, "/nonvol0", "CF", 0, 0);
**      status = OS_mount("/nonvol0", "/cf");
