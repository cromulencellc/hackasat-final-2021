# This is a shell script that sets the environment variables for
# a CFS mission build. The makefiles depend on the variables being
# set correctly.
#
# This script requires the "bash" shell to run. It should work on Linux,
# Mac OS X, and Cygwin.

# Variable: EXCLUDE_CFE_TBL
#
# EXCLUDE_CFE_TBL controls whether, or not, the CFE Table Services 
#   application is included in the CFE-CORE. The value of EXCLUDE_CFE_TBL
#   must be set equal to TRUE to cause Table Services to be excluded from
#   the CFE-CORE.  Any definition of EXCLUDE_CFE_TBL that does not set the
#   value equal to TRUE (or no definition at all) will result in the
#   inclusion of Table Services.

## export EXCLUDE_CFE_TBL=TRUE

#
# Variable: CFS_MISSION

#   export CFS_MISSION=/opt/missions/mission-xyz
#   export CFS_MISSION=C:/Projects/mission-xyz
# Having an absolute path would be necessary for including this file in a
# shared login script.
