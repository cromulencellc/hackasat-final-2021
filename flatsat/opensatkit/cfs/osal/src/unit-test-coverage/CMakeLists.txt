# CMake build script for OSAL white-box coverage tests
#
# IMPORTANT: This is currently implemented as a completely separate project
# from OSAL itself and it is not connected to the normal OSAL build in any way.
# To run coverage tests this must be built separately.  There are several reasons
# for having it this way:
#    - Not all targets have coverage testing implemented (yet).  Only VxWorks right now.
#    - It may use an entirely different toolchain than the actual target build. 
#       (coverage tests run with the "real" calls stubbed out, so they can be executed
#        on any platform/os - case in point, the VxWorks coveraged paths can be analyzed
#        by running the code on Linux using the specially-crafted inputs) 
#    - By definition this MUST completely rebuild OSAL to add the requisite "coverage" 
#      options so that the binaries include the extra instrumentation.
#
#  NO ARTEFACTS FROM THIS BUILD SHOULD EVER INTERMINGLE WITH THE REAL TARGET BUILD 
#
