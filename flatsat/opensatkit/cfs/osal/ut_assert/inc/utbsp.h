 *
 * Types and definitions for the generic Unit Test BSP interface implemented
 * as part of OSAL.
 *
 * When the OSAL BSP is used to start the tests, the same BSP can also be used to output
 * test status, this way alternate output resources can be used whenever needed.
 *
 * Provides a means to abstract the test start/stop and pass/fail reporting
 * to a board-specific function.  This allows tests to be better utilized on
 * embedded targets that may not have a visible printf() function.
 *
 * (We should not assume a working "printf" anywhere in UT-assert)
 *
 * It also provides for BSP customizations to the way tests are launched
 * and the way pass/fail determinations are made.
