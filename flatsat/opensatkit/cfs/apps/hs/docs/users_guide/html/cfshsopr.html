<h1><a class="anchor" id="cfshsopr">Health and Safety Operation </a></h1><p>The Health and Safety Application consists of several mostly independent components. The following describes these components and their potential uses.<br/>
</p>
<h2>Application Monitor </h2>
<p>The HS Application Application Monitor (AppMon), sometimes referred to as the Applications Monitor, is used to take action when a table defined application fails to increment its Execution Counter for the table defined number of cycles. The HS Application will not start monitoring applications until system startup has been completed (CFE_ES_WaitForStartupSync returns, whether because the system is finished starting up, or because it timed out).<br/>
</p>
<p>AppMon checks the execution count each cycle for each application defined in the Application Monitor Table. If the current value of the execution counter matches the value of the counter during the previous cycle then the "missing" count is decremented, otherwise the "missing" count is reset to the table defined threshold count value. If the "missing" count reaches zero, then the table defined action is taken.<br/>
</p>
<p>Once the "missing" count reaches zero and the action is taken, that table entry is disabled until Application Monitoring (as a whole) is commanded to be enabled (it does not matter if Application Monitoring is disabled first), or a new Application Monitor Table is loaded. <br/>
</p>
<p>An application may appear in the Application Monitor Table more than once, allowing it to have multiple actions. This might be used to attempt to restart an application, and failing that (having a larger timeout threshold) perform a processor reset. Another use might be to take another action (perhaps a Message Action causing a Power-On Reset) if the HS Max Processor Reset limit has been reached. This ability also might be used for sending multiple Message Actions. <br/>
</p>
<p>If an application is not currently running on the system, then it is considered to not be incrementing its counter (which does not exist). The HS Application itself does not know whether the Application is legitimately missing, or was incorrectly specified in the table, so it assumes that it is a real, missing application. If Processor Reset Limiting is not set properly, such an application missing at startup could even lead to an infinite reset loop. <br/>
<br/>
</p>
<h2>Event Monitor </h2>
<p>The HS Application Event Monitor (EventMon), sometimes referred to as the Events Monitor, is used to take action when a table defined application generates an event with a table defined Event ID number. The HS Application will not start monitoring events until system startup has been completed (CFE_ES_WaitForStartupSync returns, whether because the system is finished starting up, or because it timed out). Note that EventMon does not monitor the contents of events, only the generation of them (by Event ID number). <br/>
</p>
<p>EventMon can only monitor events that have not been filtered by Event Services (EVS). If EVS filters out an event, it will not be sent out, and so HS will never receive it.<br/>
</p>
<p>EventMon checks all generated events once each cycle, checking the events generated during the previous cycle. For each event received, the Event ID number is checked against the each Event ID number in the Event Monitor Table; if the Event ID number matches, then the Application Name is compared, and if it too matches, then the event monitor takes the table specified action. If the Event Monitor Table contains multiple instances of an Application Name/Event ID number pair, then multiple actions will be taken in the order listed in the table. If one of the multiple actions is a Processor Reset action, and the HS Application has not reached its maximum number of Processor Reset attempts (and so a reset occurs), then no further actions would be taken. <br/>
<br/>
</p>
<h2>Message Actions </h2>
<p>Message Actions allow the HS Application to send a message on the software bus by an action type from the Application Monitor or Event Monitor. While this would typically be used to send a command, it is also possible to send a telemetry message. Each Message Action only sends a single message, but Application Monitoring or Event Monitoring tables can be set up to perform multiple actions for the same application or event if multiple messages are needed. Each Message Action has its own action type. <br/>
</p>
<p>The Message Actions table can specify a cooldown for each message it can send; the cooldown determines how many cycles must be waited before the message can be sent again. For example, if a message has a cooldown value of 4, and is sent due to a monitored event, then if the same event is received again in the next three cycles, no message would be sent; if it is received again on the 4th cycle or later, the message will be sent again. A cooldown value of 1 means the message can be sent once per cycle. A cooldown value of 0 means the message can be sent multiple times per cycle. <br/>
<br/>
</p>
<h2>Processor Reset Limiting </h2>
<p>The HS Application limits the number of Processor Resets that it will perform to prevent the system from getting into an infinite reset loop. HS keeps track of how many processor resets it has performed in a Critical Data Store; if this CDS is corrupt or does not exist (due to design or Power-On reset) then it assumes 0 resets have been performed by HS. Because Executive Services (ES) will perform a Power-On reset after a defined threshold of Processor Resets have occured, the threshold value for HS Processor Resets should be set to less than this, if the developer wants to use HS Processor Reset Limiting (conversely, it should be set higher if the developer does not want to use limiting). A Max HS Processor Reset value of 0 means that HS will never attempt to perform a processor reset. <br/>
</p>
<p>If there is the desire to bypass Reset Limiting for some but not all situations (especially if a Power-On reset might be necessary), then Message Actions can be used to command a reset via ES. HS will not consider this an HS caused Processor Reset and will not increment its counter for this. <br/>
<br/>
</p>
<h2>Watchdog Management </h2>
<p>The HS Application enables and initializes the timeout value of the hardware watchdog once at startup. Note that this is the only time that the HS Application will set the watchdog timeout via the CFE_PSP_WatchdogSet() function. <br/>
</p>
<p>The HS Application nominally services the hardware watchdog once every cycle using CFE_PSP_WatchdogService(). The HS Application will only disable this periodic servicing of the watchdog when it attempts to perform a processor reset (in response to Event or Application monitoring) as a contingency against CFE_ES_ResetCFE() failing; nominally the processor reset will re-initialize HS which will once again initialize and service the watchdog. <br/>
</p>
<p>If the developer wishes to occassionally set a longer watchdog timeout in situations where HS may be prevented from running by a higher priority task for extended periods of time, this may be accomplished using the CFE_PSP_WatchdogSet() API with a larger timeout value. As the HS Application only sets the timeout value at startup, if it does run during that time the watchdog will be reset to larger value. After setting the new timeout value, the developer should service using the watchdog using CFE_PSP_WatchdogService() to ensure that the new timeout value is being used. Prior to setting the new timeout value, the developer should get the current timeout value using CFE_PSP_WatchdogGet(), and restore this value after the larger value is no longer needed. <br/>
<br/>
</p>
<h2>Execution Counter Reporting </h2>
<p>The HS Application provides the ability to report execution counter data in telemetry. Execution counter data can be reported for both applications and child tasks. <br/>
</p>
<p>If the application or task specified in the a table entry fails to be found (either due to absence or improper naming), or if no application or task is specified, the telemetry associated with with that entry will read 0xFFFFFFFF. If no table is present, then all associated telemetry will read 0xFFFFFFFF. <br/>
</p>
<p>The Execution Counter Telemetry reporting functionality is optional, and is not included in the build process if no counters will be reported (the Execution Counter Table to support this functionality would also not exist in such a case). <br/>
<br/>
</p>
<h2>Aliveness Indication </h2>
<p>The Aliveness indicator will, if enabled (either by command or by configuration parameter), output the predefined configuration parameter string using OS_printf() at the configuration parameter determined rate. <br/>
</p>
<h2>CPU Utilization Monitoring and Hogging Detection </h2>
<p>The HS Application creates an Idle Child Task at a low priority, that is used to determine the portion of CPU utilization not being used by other applications. The Idle Child Task continually increments a counter while running; and this counter is recorded at 1 Hz by a TIME 1 Hz callback function. When the HS application runs each cycle, it will compute the non-Idle Child Task utilization that occurred during the previous cycle and report the average utilization, peak utilization, and determine if the processor is being hogged. The frequency at which the count is recorded and at which the HS application computes utilization can be configured to be other than 1 Hz or 1 cycle if necessary. <br/>
</p>
<p>If the utilization is in excess of a configurable amount for a configurable period of time, then the CPU Hogging event message will be sent. This message can be used to by HS Event Monitoring to perform whatever action the user desires. <br/>
</p>
<p>The Idle Child Task requires calibration to perform properly, and provides the ability to perform the necessary calibrations using the software itself. See the deployment portion of this guide for more information on calibration. <br/>
