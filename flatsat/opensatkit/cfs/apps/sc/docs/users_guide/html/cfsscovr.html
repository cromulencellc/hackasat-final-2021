<h1><a class="anchor" id="cfsscovr">CFS Stored Command Overview </a></h1><p>The CFS Stored Command appliaction allows the spacecraft to be commanded 24 hours a day using sequences of commands that are loaded from the ground. Each command has a time tag associated with it, permitting the command to be released for distribution at predetermined times. SC supports both Absolute Time tagged command Sequences (ATSs) as well as multiple Relative Time tagged command Sequences (RTSs).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="SC">
Design Overview</a></h2>
<p>The CFS Stored Command application is driven off of the 1Hz packet from the Scheduler Application. When the 1Hz is received, SC looks to see if there are stored commands to execute (in the ATS and the RTS's). If there are commands to be executed in this second, SC will execute them up until <a class="el" href="sc__platform__cfg_8h.html#a2be6567285840d1c4f1615fd7ef214ec">SC_MAX_CMDS_PER_SEC</a> commands are executed. SC is also driven off of the housekeeping request packet from the Scheduler Application. When SC receives the HK request, it processes the request, sends out the housekeeping packet, and looks for table updates to the load/dump tables that SC maintains. SC is also driven by commands, responding to them as they are received.</p>
