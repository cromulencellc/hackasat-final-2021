**       - \b \c \SC_CMDPC       - command counter will increment
**       - The #SC_DISRTSGRP_CMD_INF_EID event will indicate the number of RTS

**
**  \par Error Conditions
**       This command may fail for the following reason(s):
**       - Command packet length not as expected
**       - Invalid group definition, first RTS ID must be 1 through #SC_NUMBER_OF_RTS
**       - Invalid group definition, last RTS ID must be 1 through #SC_NUMBER_OF_RTS
**       - Invalid group definition, last RTS ID must be greater than or equal to first RTS ID
**       - If the group definition is valid the command will report success, regardless of
**         whether the group contained an RTS that was not already DISABLED.

**  \par Evidence of failure may be found in the following telemetry: 
**       - \b \c \SC_CMDEC - command error counter will increment
**       - The #SC_LEN_ERR_EID event will indicate invalid command packet length.
