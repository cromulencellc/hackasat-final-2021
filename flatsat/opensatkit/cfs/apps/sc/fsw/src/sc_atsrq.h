/** \brief Switches ATS's at a safe time

 **  \par Description
 **       This function does the ATS switch when it is determined that

 **       switch pend flag was set. After every scheduling of the SCP,

 **       set, this routine is called. This routine checks to see that
 **       the current time is one second past the time to start the
 **       new ATS. If it is the correct time, then the switch is performed.
 **       All of this has the effect of creating a syncronized switch of
 **       the ATS buffers, assuring that no duplicate commands are sent.

/** \brief Jump time in an ATS Command
 **  
 **  \par Description
 **         This command is used to jump to a specified time in the 
 **         currently running ATS. The jump command will effectively 
 **         restart the ATS at the time given in the command. Because 
 **         there is no restriction on the time given in the command, 
 **         the ATP may try to restart the ATS at any time before or 
 **         after the current time. In the case of the time tag being
 **         before the current time, ( a backwards jump ) the ATP will 
 **         simply skip the commands that have been executed ( or failed 
 **         execution ) and end up at the same location as before. In the 
 **         case of the jump time being after the current time, the ATP 
 **         will skip all commands with time tags less than the jump time 
 **         and start executing the ATS at the time equal to the jump 
 **         time. If there are no commands with time tags equal to the 
 **         jump time, the ATP will set up the ATS to wait for the first 
 **         command after the jump time. When a command is skipped while 
 **         doing the jump, the command's status is marked as SKIPPED unless
 **         it has already been marked as EXECUTED, FAILED_DISTRIBUTION, 
 **         or FAILED_CHECKSUM.
