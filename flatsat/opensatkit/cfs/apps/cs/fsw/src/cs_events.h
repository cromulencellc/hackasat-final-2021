 **   Revision 1.12.1.1 2015/03/03 11:58:56EST sstrege 
 **   Added copyright information
 **   Revision 1.12 2015/02/25 16:38:27EST lwalling 
 **   Document issue when recomputing the checksum for the CS Tables Definition Table when one entry is for the Definition table itself
 **   Revision 1.11 2011/09/06 14:51:21EDT jmdagost 
 **   Corrected app-not-found and table-not-found event IDs, and updated many doxygen comments.
 **   Revision 1.10 2010/07/19 13:28:36EDT jmdagost 
 **   Corrected doxygen formatting of field descriptions for various event messages.
 **   Revision 1.9 2010/04/14 16:12:50EDT jmdagost 
 **   Updated doxygen descriptions for 12 messages to include possibility that unfound table/app entry might be marked as CS_STATE_EMPTY.
 **   Revision 1.8 2010/04/13 17:57:35EDT jmdagost 
 **   Added event messages for table validation, including duplicate names for apps or tables, enabled/disabled entries with zero-length names, and summary messages for validation.
 **   Revision 1.7 2010/03/29 16:47:35EDT jmdagost 
 **   Added debug-level messages for "entry missing from definitions table" events.
 **   Revision 1.6 2009/06/11 11:20:15EDT rmcgraw 
 **   DCR82191:1 Changed OS_Mem function calls to CFE_PSP_Mem
 **   Revision 1.5 2008/10/17 08:39:59EDT njyanchik 
 **   Updated Event messages
 **   Revision 1.4 2008/07/28 16:56:08BST njyanchik 
 **   Fixed app/table naming issues in event messages
