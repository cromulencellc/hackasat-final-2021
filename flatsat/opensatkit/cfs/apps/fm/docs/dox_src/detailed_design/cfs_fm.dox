/**
  \page cfsfmovr CFS File Manager Overview

  The CFS FM application provides onboard file system management services by processing ground commands
  for copying, moving, and renaming files, decompressing files, creating directories, deleting files and 
  directories, providing file and directory informational telemetry messages, and providing open file and 
  directory listings.  The FM software context diagram is shown in Figure FM-1.  
  
  \image html CFS_FM_Context.jpg "Figure FM-1" <BR>

  The FM application interfaces with the Command Ingest (CI) application to receive ground commands.  
  See page \ref cfsfmcmds for a detailed description of the FM ground commands.  FM utilizes the Operating 
  System Abstraction Layer (OSAL) API library functions for interfacing with the onboard file systems when 
  processing ground commands.  The FM application interfaces with the 
  <A HREF="../sch/index.html">Scheduler (SCH) Application</A> for 
  receiving periodic housekeeping requests.  Upon receipt of a housekeeping request, FM will send its 
  housekeeping telemetry packets on the Software Bus.  Housekeeping telemetry packets are subscribed to 
  by the Housekeeping (HK), Telemetry Output (TO), and Data Storage applications.  See page 
  \ref cfsfmtlm for a detailed description of the contents of the FM housekeeping telemetry packet. <BR>

  <H1>Initialization </H1>

  <BR><B> Power-On and Processor Resets </B><BR>

  Upon a Power-On or Processor reset the FM application initializes all telemetry within its housekeeping 
  telemetry packet.  The Command and Command Error counters are set to zero, as well as, all other 
  numerical data within the packet.  In addition to initializing telemetry, FM registers for cFE event 
  services, creates its software bus message pipe, and subscribes to FM SB housekeeping requests and 
  commands. <BR>

  <BR><B> Normal Operation </B><BR>

  The CFS FM application is a command and telemetry driven application.  FM waits in a command loop 
  infinitely until the software receives a scheduled housekeeping request, ground command, or stored 
  command.  Command packets (including housekeeping requests) are processed as they are received.  The 
  application sends an FM housekeeping telemetry message to the ground upon receipt of a scheduled 
  housekeeping request produced by the SCH application.  This request is typically performed every 
  4-5 seconds. <BR>  

  Various FM ground commands produce telemetry messages as a result of processing the command.  These 
  telemetry messages include a directory listing telemetry message, file information telemetry message, 
  and an open file listing telemetry message. See page \ref cfsfmcmds for a detailed description of the 
  FM directory listing, file information, and open file listing ground commands.  See page \ref cfsfmtlm 
  for a detailed description of the contents of the FM directory listing, file information, and open file 
  listing telemetry messages. <BR>  

  Other FM ground commands produce files as a result of processing the command.  These files include a 
  decompression file, concatenation file, and a directory listing file.  See page \ref cfsfmcmds for a 
  detailed description of the FM decompress file, concatenate files, and directory listing file ground 
  commands. <BR>
  
  The decompression file is produced using the cFE API function #CFE_FS_Decompress which uses code ported 
  from the GNU zip sources.  The cFE API function #CFE_FS_Decompress produces the decompressed output file.  
  The output file is comparable to that of a file that has been unzipped using the system utility gunzip.  
  A compressed file reduces the size of the file by encoding the file.  Compressed files may be used to 
  reduce uplink time to the spacecraft.  Decompressing the file will restore the file from its encoded 
  state to the original state of the file. <BR>

  The concatenation file is a direct copy of the contents of the two command specified source files, 
  with the contents of the first source file specified proceeding the contents of the second source 
  file specified.  The contents of the second source file are written with no delineation characters 
  such as spaces or returns following the contents of the first source file. <BR>     

  The directory listing file is written as a binary file and contains a cFE file header at the top of 
  the file contiguously followed by a directory listing status data structure containing an echo of the 
  command specified directory name (#OS_MAX_PATH_LEN), directory size in bytes (uint32), total number of 
  file contained in the directory (uint32), and the number of file names written in the directory listing 
  file (uint32).  The directory listing is then written contiguously one entry at a time.  Each entry in 
  the directory listing includes for each file in the directory, the name of the file(#OS_MAX_PATH_LEN), 
  file size in bytes (uint32), and last modification time of the file (uint32).  File systems use specific 
  time epochs for their time tagging of files.  Since spacecraft systems rarely use an epoch that matches 
  a particular file system, a function is used to convert the file system time (in seconds) to spacecraft 
  time (in seconds).  The conversion is controlled by a cFE configuration parameter which is set equal to 
  the number of seconds between the spacecraft's epoch and the file system's epoch.  See #CFE_FS_Header_t 
  for the cFE file header format.  See #FM_DirListFileStat_t for the format of the directory listing 
  status structure.  See #FM_DirListFileData_t for the format of a directory listing entry. <BR>
