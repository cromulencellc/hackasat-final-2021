/** \fmcfg Child Task File I/O Control Settings
**
**  \par Description:
**       These definitions control the amount of file data that the FM child task
**       will process before giving up the CPU to allow other tasks time to run.
**
**       FM_CHILD_FILE_BLOCK_SIZE defines the size of each block of file data that
**       the FM child task will read or write.  This value also defines the size
**       of the FM child task I/O buffer that exists in global memory.
**
**       FM_CHILD_FILE_LOOP_COUNT defines the number of file data blocks that may
**       be processed before the FM child task sleeps (gives up the CPU).
**
**       FM_CHILD_FILE_SLEEP_MS defines the length of time (in milli-secs) before
**       the FM child task wakes (re-acquires the CPU).  Note that many platforms
**       will limit the precision of this value.
**
**       Thus the combination of the 3 values control CPU use by the FM child task.
**       Using a smaller block size minimizes the amount of RAM used by the file
**       I/O buffer, but at the expense of file efficiency.  Adjust each of the
**       values such that the combination is appropriate for the target platform.
**
**       For example, if the block size is 2048 and the loop count is 16 and the
**       sleep time is 20, then while processing a 1 Mbyte file there will be
**       32 sleep cycles of 20ms each, for a total task delay of 0.64 seconds.
**
**  \par Limits:
**       FM_CHILD_FILE_BLOCK_SIZE: The FM application limits this value to be no
**       less than 256 bytes and no greater than 32KB.
**
**       FM_CHILD_FILE_LOOP_COUNT: The FM application limits this value to be
**       non-zero.  There is no upper limit - a very large number effectively
**       means that the FM child task will not surrender the CPU to other lower
**       priority tasks.
**
**       FM_CHILD_FILE_SLEEP_MS: The FM application limits this value to be no
**       no greater than 100 ms.  The value zero generally means a very short
**       task delay - refer to the target platform documentation for specifics.

/** \fmcfg Child file stat sleep
**
**  \par Description:
**       OS_stat is a CPU intensive call. FM uses the OS_stat call to query a 
**       fileâ€™s size, date, and mode when setting up directory listings. 
**       Querying a large number of files and/or files large in size when 
**       processing directory listing commands can cause FM to hog the CPU. To
**       mitigate this, options to sleep a configurable number of milliseconds 
**       between calls to OS_stat for a configurable number of files
**       in a directory listing is provided. A large sleep cycle will not hang the CPU
**       but it may take a long time for directory listing to complete. A shorter
**       sleep cycle will speed up the directory listing commands but may cause
**       FM to hog the CPU.
**       
**       FM_CHILD_STAT_SLEEP_MS: The number of milliseconds to sleep each
**       cycle. One cycle is FM_CHILD_STAT_SLEEP_FILECOUNT.
**       
**       FM_CHILD_STAT_SLEEP_FILECOUNT: The number of files to process (OS_stat) before 
**       sleeping FM_CHILD_STAT_SLEEP_MS.
**       Works in tandem with FM_CHILD_STAT_SLEEP_MS to reduce CPU hogging
**       while allowing slightly more customization to balance time the operator is waiting to
**       get data back from a directory listing versus FM hogging the CPU with calls to OS_stat
**        
**       In short:
**       High SLEEP_MS means less CPU hogging by FM but a longer time to process a dir listing command
**       Low SLEEP_MS means more potential CPU hogging by FM but shorter time to process a dir listing command
**       High FILECOUNT means more potential CPU hogging by FM but a shorter time to process a dir listing command
**       Low FILECOUNT means less CPU hogging by FM but longer time to process a dir listing command
**  \par Limits:
**       The default is zero unless the mission needs require them to be changed.

/** \fmcfg Child Task Command Queue Entry Count

**       This definition sets the array depth for the command arguments queue in

**       the upper limit for the number of commands that can be waiting in the
**       queue to be processed by the low priority FM child task.  A multi-entry
**       command queue prevents the occasional slow command from being rejected
**       because the child task has not yet completed the previous slow command.
**
**  \par Limits:
**       The FM application limits this value to be no less than 1 and no greater
**       than 10.  There must be at least one because this is the method for
**       passing command arguments from the parent to the child task.  The upper

**
**  \par Limits:
**       Value to be no less than 1 and no greater than 255.  
**
**  \par Priority Values:
**       Note that a small value has higher priority than a large value.
**       Thus, 100 is higher priority than 150. It is also necessary to
**       ensure that a child task has lower priority than its parent.
**       It should be clear that a child task that runs ahead of its
**       parent defeats the purpose of having a child task to run in
