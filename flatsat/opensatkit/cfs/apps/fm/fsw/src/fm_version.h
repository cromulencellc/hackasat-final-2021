**  Application Version Information:
**
**  Major.Minor.Revision.Mission_Rev
**
**  Major: Major update.  This would include major changes or new functionality.
**         Most likely will include database schema changes and interface changes.
**         Probably not backwards compatible with older versions
**
**	Minor: Minor change, may introduce new features, but backwards compatibility is mostly
**         retained.  Likely will include schema changes.
**
**  Revision: Minor bug fixes, no significant new features implemented, though a few small
**            improvements may be included.  May include a schema change.
**
**  Mission_Rev:  Used by users of the applications (nominally missions) to denote changes made
**                by the mission.  Releases from the Flight Softare Reuse Library (FSRL) should
**                use Mission_Rev zero (0).
