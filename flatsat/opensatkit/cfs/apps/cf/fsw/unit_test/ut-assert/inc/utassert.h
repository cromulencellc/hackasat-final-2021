 *
 * Purpose: This file contains a standard set of asserts for use in unit tests.
 *
 * Design Notes: 
 *    - All asserts evaluate a expression as TRUE or FALSE to determine if a unit test has 
 *      passed or failed.  TRUE means the test passed, FALSE means the test failed.
 *    - All asserts return a boolen result to indicate the pass fail status.
 *    - All asserts are implemented as macros to hide the __LINE__ and __FILE__ macros.
 *    - All asserts must call the function UtAssert.
