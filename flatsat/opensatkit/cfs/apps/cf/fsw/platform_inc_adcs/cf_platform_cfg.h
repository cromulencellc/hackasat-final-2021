**
**  \par Description:
**       This group of configuration parameters dictates what CF events will be

**       initializes and stay in effect until changed via EVS command.

**              #define CF_FILTER_MASK1             0
**       To filter the event, set the mask value to CFE_EVS_FIRST_ONE_STOP
**       To disable filtering of the event, set mask value to CFE_EVS_NO_FILTER
**
