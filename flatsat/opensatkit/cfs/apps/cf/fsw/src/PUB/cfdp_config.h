 * LAST MODIFIED:  2007_06_11
 * ORIGINAL PROGRAMMER:  Tim Ray 301-286-0581
 * SUMMARY:  The CFDP library user is free to modify this file as desired
 *   (all other files in the PUB and PRI directories are not to be changed).
 *   Use this file to configure the CFDP library.
 * CHANGES:
 *   2006_08_21 Tim Ray
 *     - Boiled 5 Filedata-size parameters down to 2.  
 *   2006_09_08 Tim Ray
 *     - Put "#ifndef" around each generic data type (to use the lib in
 *       ASIST).
 *   2007_05_17 Tim Ray
 *     - No longer allow a choice between enabling/disabling dynamic
 *       memory allocation.  Engine always uses static allocation.
 *   2007_06_11 Tim Ray
 *     - Sets default value for new MIB parameter 'save_incomplete_files'.

 * in length.  The safest value for this parameter is 8, but if memory
 * usage is an issue, it can be set to a smaller value (if there are only two
