** File: cfe_sb_msg_id_util.c
**
** Purpose:
**      This file contains 'access' macros and functions for reading and
**      writing message ID header fields.
**      
**      The function prototypes are in cfe_sb.h except for ConvertMsgIdToMsgKey
**      which is in cfe_sb_priv.h
*
**      The MsgId is a mission defined message identifier to publish or subscribe to that must be 
**      unique within the system(s). CFE_SB_MsgId_t is a uint32 that can be created from any 
**      combination of bits from the primary header SID (StreamId) and the secondary header APID Qualifiers
**      
**      Implementation is based on CCSDS Space Packet Protocol 133.0.B-1 with Technical Corrigendum 2, September 2012
**      The extended secondary header is expected in an upcoming revision of 133.0.B-1
**
**      For  MESSAGE_FORMAT_IS_CCSDS_VER_2 the default setup will combine:
**       1 bit for the command/telemetry flag 
**       7 bits from the primary header APID
**       0 bits from the Playback flag
**       8 bits from the secondary header APID qualifier (Subsystem)
**       0 bits from the secondary header APID qualifier as the System
**    = 16 bits total 
**     
**
**     The APID qualifier System field can be populated in the Secondary header but
**     but will be ignored in the default case for SB/SBN routing purposes. It is suggested 
**     that the CCSDS Spacecraft ID be used for that field.
**
** Notes: The following 4 terms have been or are used in the cFS architecture and implementation
**         
**      StreamId - First 16 bits of CCSDS Space Packet Protocol (SPP) 133.0-B.1c2 Blue Book 
**                 packet primary header. It contains the 3 bit Version Number, 1 bit Packet Type ID,
**                 1 bit Secondary Header flag, and 11 bit Application Process ID
**                 It was used in earlier cFS implementaions and defined here for historical reference
**                 It is NOT exposed to user applications.
**
**      MsgId    - Unique numeric message identifier within a mission namespace. It is used by cFS
**                 applications to the identify messages for publishing and subscribing
**                 It is used by the SB API and encoded in a mission defended way in the header of 
**                 all cFS messages.
**                 It is exposed to all cFS applications
**
**      ApId     - CCSDS Application Process Id field in the primary header. 
**                 It has default bit mask of 0x07FF and is part of the cFS message Id
**                 It should not be confused with the cFE Executive Services (ES) term appId which
**                 identifies the software application/component
**                 It is NOT exposed to user applications.
**
**      MsgIdkey - This is a unique numeric key within a mission namespace that is used with  
**                 cFS software bus internal structures. 
**                 It is algorithmically created in a mission defined way from the MsgId to support
**                 efficient lookup and mapping implementations 
**                 It is NOT exposed to user applications.
